# Noughts and Crosses Android App

A modern implementation of the classic Noughts and Crosses game for Android devices, featuring both single-player and two-player gameplay modes.

Often referred to as Tic Tac Toe, is a timeless classic among board games. Its simplicity, yet potential for strategic depth, has made it a favorite pastime for people of all ages around the world. This game, played on a 3x3 grid, requires two players who take turns marking the grid with their respective symbols, typically "X" and "O." The objective is straightforward: be the first to complete a row, column, or diagonal with your symbols.

This repository is a version of the [TicTacToe](https://github.com/Armaan4477/TicTacToe) Game with pre-rendered animations instead of lottie animations which was a requirement for the project submission
